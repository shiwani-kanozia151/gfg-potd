Array Duplicates

Given an array arr[] of size n, containing elements from the range 1 to n, and each element appears at most twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.
Note: You can return the elements in any order but the driver code will print them in sorted order.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
Output: [2, 3] 
Explanation: 2 and 3 occur more than once in the given array.

Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2] 
Output: []
Explanation: There is no repeating element in the array, so the output is empty.

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n

CODE: using extra space 
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& arr) {
        // code here
        set<int>st;
        int n=arr.size();
        
        vector<int>res;
        
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
            if(st.find(arr[i]) != st.end())
             res.push_back(arr[i]);
             
            st.insert(arr[i]);
            
        }
          
        return res;  
         
    }
};
